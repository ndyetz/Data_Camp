#Introduction

The following documentoutlines the written portion of the lessons from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)'s ["Intro to Python for Data Science" course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science). This is a beginner course that requires little knowledge in Python programming. 

As a note: All text is completely copied and pasted from the course. There are insances where the document refers to the "editor on the right", please note, that in this notebook document all of the instances are noted in the "Python-chunks" (areas containing working python-code), which occurs below the text, rather than to the right.

<u>*If you have this document open on "R-Notebook", simply click "run" -> "Run all" (Or just press 'ctrl + alt + r'), let the "r-chunks" run (This might take a bit of time) then click "Preview". All necssary data is embedded within the code, no need to set a working directory or open an R-project.*</u> Additionally,  will need to ensure that python is set as a usable path in your windows environment because this will be executed through R-studio. [Here is a helpful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXqTw5eO0Mw). If you have utilized Jupyter notebooks, then it is the same process for getting those connected.

#Chapter 1: Python Basics
An introduction to the basic concepts of Python. Learn how to use Python both interactively and through a script. Create your first variables and acquaint yourself with Python's basic data types.

##The Python Interface 

In the Python script on the right, you can type Python code to solve the exercises. If you hit Submit Answer, your python script (`script.py`) is executed and the output is shown in the IPython Shell. DataCamp checks whether your submission is correct and gives you feedback.

You can hit Submit Answer as often as you want. If you're stuck, you can click Get Hint, and ultimately Get Solution.

You can also use the IPython Shell interactively by simply typing commands and hitting Enter. When you work in the shell directly, your code will not be checked for correctness so it is a great way to experiment

**Instructions**

Experiment in the IPython Shell; type `5 / 8`, for example.
Add another line of code to the Python script: `print(7 + 10)`.
Hit Submit Answer to execute the Python script and receive feedback.


```{python}
# Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)

# Put code below here
print(7 + 10)
```

##Any comments?

Something that Filip didn't mention in his videos is that you can add comments to your Python scripts. Comments are important to make sure that you and others can understand what your code is about.

To add comments to your Python script, you can use the `#` tag. These comments are not run as Python code, so they will not influence your result. As an example, take the comment on the right, `# Just testing division`; it is completely ignored during execution.

**Instructions**

Above the `print(7 + 10)`, add the comment `# Addition works too`.

```{python}
# Just testing division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition works too
print(7 + 10) 

```

##Python as a calculator
Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as:

Exponentiation: `**`. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example `4**2` will give `16`.

Modulo: `%`. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example `18 % 7` equals `4`.

The code in the script on the right gives some examples.

**Instructions**

Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year. After one year, it's 100?1.1=110 dollars, and after two years it's 100?1.1?1.1=121. Add code on the right to calculate how much money you end up with after 7 years.

```{python}
# Addition and subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication and division
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)

# Exponentiation
print(4 ** 2)

# Modulo
print(18 % 7)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100*1.1**7)
```

##Variable Assignment
In Python, a variable allows you to refer to a value with a name. To create a variable use `=`, like this example:

```
x = 5
```

You can now use the name of this variable, `x`, instead of the actual value, `5`.

Remember, = in Python means assignment, it doesn't test equality!

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Create a variable `savings` with the value `100`.

Check out this variable by typing `print(savings)` in the script.

```{python}
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Print out savings
print(savings)
```

##Calculations with variables

Remember how you calculated the money you ended up with after 7 years of investing $100? You did something like this:

```
100 * 1.10 ** 7
```

Instead of calculating with the actual values, you can use variables instead. The `savings` variable you've created in the previous exercise represents the $100 you started with. It's up to you to create a new variable to represent `1.10` and then redo the calculations!

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Create a variable `factor`, equal to `1.10`.

Use `savings` and `factor` to calculate the amount of money you end up with after 7 years. Store the result in a new variable, `result`.

Print out the value of `result`.

```{python}
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable factor
factor = 1.10

# Calculate result
result = (savings * factor**7)

# Print out result
print(result)
```

##Other variable types

In the previous exercise, you worked with two Python data types:

`int`, or integer: a number without a fractional part. `savings`, with the value `100`, is an example of an integer.

`floa`t, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. `factor`, with the value `1.10,` is an example of a float.

Next to numerical data types, there are two other very common data types:

`str`, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.

`bool`, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. Can only be `True` or `False` (the capitalization is important!).

INSTRUCTIONS

Create a new string, `desc`, with the value `"compound interest"`.

Create a new boolean, `profitable`, with the value `True`.

```{python}
# Create a variable desc
desc = "compound interest"

# Create a variable profitable
profitable = True

```

##Operations with other types

Filip mentioned that different types behave differently in Python.

When you sum two strings, for example, you'll get different behavior than when you sum two integers or two booleans.

In the script some variables with different types have already been created. It's up to you to use them.

INSTRUCTIONS

Calculate the product of `savings` and `factor`. Store the result in `year1`.

What do you think the resulting type will be? Find out by printing out the type of `year1`.

Calculate the sum of `desc` and `desc` and store the result in a new variable `doubledesc`.

Print out `doubledesc`. Did you expect this?

```{python}
# Several variables to experiment with
savings = 100
factor = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of factor and savings to year1
year1 = (savings*factor)

# Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = (desc + desc)

# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)

```

##Type conversion

Using the `+` operator to paste together two strings can be very useful in building custom messages.

Suppose, for example, that you've calculated the return of your investment and want to summarize the results in a string. Assuming the floats `savings` and `result` are defined, you can try something like this:

```
print("I started with $" + savings + " and now have $" + result + ". Awesome!")
```

This will not work, though, as you cannot simply sum strings and floats.

To fix the error, you'll need to explicitly convert the types of your variables. More specifically, you'll need `str()`, to convert a value into a string. `str(savings)`, for example, will convert the float savings to a string.

Similar functions such as `int()`, `float()` and `bool()` will help you convert Python values into any type.

INSTRUCTIONS


Hit Submit Answer to run the code on the right. Try to understand the error message.

Fix the code on the right such that the printout runs without errors; use the function `str()` to convert the variables to strings.

Convert the variable `pi_string` to a float and store this float as a new variable, `pi_float`.

```{python}

# Definition of savings and result
savings = 100
result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(result) + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float = float(pi_string)
```


#Chapter 2: Python Lists
Learn to store, access and manipulate data in lists: the first step towards efficiently working with huge amounts of data.

##Create a list

As opposed to `int`, `bool` etc., a list is a **compound data type**; you can group values together:

```
a = "is"
b = "nice"
my_list = ["my", "list", a, b]
```

After measuring the height of your family, you decide to collect some information on the house you're living in. The areas of the different parts of your house are stored in separate variables for now, as shown in the script.

INSTRUCTIONS

Create a list, `areas`, that contains the area of the hallway (`hall`), kitchen (`kit`), living room (`liv`), bedroom (`bed`) and bathroom (`bath`), in this order. Use the predefined variables.

Print `areas` with the `print()` function.

```{python}
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# Create list areas
areas = [hall, kit, liv, bed, bath]

# Print areas
print(areas)

```

##Create list with different types

A list can contain any Python type. Although it's not really common, a list can also contain a mix of Python types including strings, floats, booleans, etc.

The printout of the previous exercise wasn't really satisfying. It's just a list of numbers representing the areas, but you can't tell which area corresponds to which part of your house.

The code on the right is the start of a solution. For some of the areas, the name of the corresponding room is already placed in front. Pay attention here! `"bathroom"` is a string, while `bath` is a variable that represents the float `9.50` you specified earlier.

INSTRUCTIONS

Finish the line of code that creates the `area`s list such that the list first contains the name of each room as a string and then its area. More specifically, add the strings `"hallway"`, `"kitchen"` and `"bedroom"` at the appropriate locations.

Print `areas` again; is the printout more informative this time?

```{python}
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# Adapt list areas
areas = ["hallway", hall, "kitchen", kit, "living room", liv, "bedroom", bed, "bathroom", bath]

# Print areas
print(areas)
```

##List of lists

As a data scientist, you'll often be dealing with a lot of data, and it will make sense to group some of this data.

Instead of creating a flat list containing strings and floats, representing the names and areas of the rooms in your house, you can create a list of lists. The script on the right can already give you an idea.

Don't get confused here: `"hallway"` is a string, while `hall` is a variable that represents the float `11.25` you specified earlier.

INSTRUCTIONS

Finish the list of lists so that it also contains the bedroom and bathroom data. Make sure you enter these in order!

Print out `house`; does this way of structuring your data make more sense?
Print out the type of `house`. Are you still dealing with a list?

```{python}
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# house information as list of lists
house = [["hallway", hall],
         ["kitchen", kit],
         ["living room", liv],
         ["bedroom", bed],
         ["bathroom", bath]]

# Print out house
print(house)

# Print out the type of house
print(type(house))
```

##Subset and conquer

Subsetting Python lists is a piece of cake. Take the code sample below, which creates a list `x` and then selects "b" from it. Remember that this is the second element, so it has index 1. You can also use negative indexing.

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1]
x[-3] # same result!
```

Remember the `areas` list from before, containing both strings and floats? Its definition is already in the script. Can you add the correct code to do some Python subsetting?

INSTRUCTIONS

Print out the second element from the `areas` list, so `11.25`.

Subset and print out the last element of `areas`, being `9.50`. Using a negative index makes sense here!

Select the number representing the area of the living room and print it out.

```{python}
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Print out second element from areas
print(areas[1])

# Print out last element from areas
print(areas[-1])

# Print out the area of the living room
print(areas[5])
```

##Subset and calculate
After you've extracted values from a list, you can use them to perform additional calculations. Take this example, where the second and fourth element of a list `x` are extracted. The strings that result are pasted together using the `+` operator:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
print(x[1] + x[3])
```

INSTRUCTIONS

Using a combination of list subsetting and variable assignment, create a new variable, `eat_sleep_area`, that contains the sum of the area of the kitchen and the area of the bedroom.

Print the new variable `eat_sleep_area`.

```{python}
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Sum of kitchen and bedroom area: eat_sleep_area
eat_sleep_area = areas[3] + areas[-3]

# Print the variable eat_sleep_area
print(eat_sleep_area)
```

##Slicing and dicing

Selecting single values from a list is just one part of the story. It's also possible to slice your list, which means selecting multiple elements from your list. Use the following syntax:

```
my_list[start:end]
```

The `start` index will be included, while the `end` index is not.

The code sample below shows an example. A list with `"b"` and `"c"`, corresponding to indexes 1 and 2, are selected from a list `x`:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1:3]
```

The elements with index 1 and 2 are included, while the element with index 3 is not.

INSTRUCTIONS

Use slicing to create a list, `downstairs`, that contains the first 6 elements of `areas`.

Do a similar thing to create a new variable, `upstairs`, that contains the last 4 elements of `areas`.

Print both `downstairs` and `upstairs` using `print()`.

```{python}
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Use slicing to create downstairs
downstairs = areas[0:6]

# Use slicing to create upstairs
upstairs = areas[6:10]

# Print out downstairs and upstairs
print(downstairs)
print(upstairs)
```

##Slicing and dicing (2)

In the video, Filip first discussed the syntax where you specify both where to begin and end the slice of your list:

```
my_list[begin:end]
```

However, it's also possible not to specify these indexes. If you don't specify the `begin` index, Python figures out that you want to start your slice at the beginning of your list. If you don't specify the `end` index, the slice will go all the way to the last element of your list. To experiment with this, try the following commands in the IPython Shell:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[:2]
x[2:]
x[:]
```

INSTRUCTIONS

Use slicing to create the lists `downstairs` and `upstairs` again, but this time without using indexes if it's not necessary. Remember `downstairs` is the first 6 elements of areas and `upstairs` is the last 4 elements of `areas`.

```{python}
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Alternative slicing to create downstairs
downstairs = areas[:6]

# Alternative slicing to create upstairs
upstairs = areas[6:]

```


##Replace list elements
Replacing list elements is pretty easy. Simply subset the list and assign new values to the subset. You can select single elements or you can change entire list slices at once.

Use the IPython Shell to experiment with the commands below. Can you tell what's happening and why?

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1] = "r"
x[2:] = ["s", "t"]
```

For this and the following exercises, you'll continue working on the `areas` list that contains the names and areas of different rooms in a house.

INSTRUCTIONS

You did a miscalculation when determining the area of the bathroom; it's 10.50 square meters instead of 9.50. Can you make the changes?

Make the `areas` list more trendy! Change "living room" to "chill zone".
```{python}
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Correct the bathroom area
areas[-1] = 10.50

# Change "living room" to "chill zone"
areas[4] = "chill zone"
```

##Extend a list
If you can change elements in a list, you sure want to be able to add elements to it, right? You can use the `+` operator:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
y = x + ["e", "f"]
```

You just won the lottery, awesome! You decide to build a poolhouse and a garage. Can you add the information to the `areas` list?

INSTRUCTIONS

Use the `+` operator to paste the list `["poolhouse", 24.5]` to the end of the `areas` list. Store the resulting list as `areas_1`.

Further extend `areas_1` by adding data on your garage. Add the string `"garage"` and float `15.45`. Name the resulting list `areas_2`.

```{python}
# Create the areas list and make some changes
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "chill zone", 20.0,
         "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 10.50]

# Add poolhouse data to areas, new list is areas_1
areas_1 = areas + ["poolhouse", 24.5]

# Add garage data to areas_1, new list is areas_2
areas_2 = areas_1 + ["garage", 15.45]
```

##Inner workings of lists

At the end of the video, Filip explained how Python lists work behind the scenes. In this exercise you'll get some hands-on experience with this.

The Python code in the script already creates a list with the name `areas` and a copy named `areas_copy`. Next, the first element in the `areas_copy` list is changed and the `areas` list is printed out. If you hit Submit Answer you'll see that, although you've changed `areas_copy`, the change also takes effect in the `areas` list. That's because `areas` and `areas_copy` point to the same list.

If you want to prevent changes in `areas_copy` to also take effect in areas, you'll have to do a more explicit copy of the areas list. You can do this with l`ist()` or by using `[:]`.

INSTRUCTIONS

Change the second command, that creates the variable `areas_copy`, such that `areas_copy` is an explicit copy of `areas`

Now, changes made to `areas_copy` shouldn't affect `areas`. Hit Submit Answer to check this.

```{python}
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Create areas_copy
areas_copy = list(areas)

# Change areas_copy
areas_copy[0] = 5.0

# Print areas
print(areas)

```


#Chapter 3: Functions & Packages
To leverage the code that brilliant Python developers have written, you'll learn about using functions, methods and packages. This will help you to reduce the amount of code you need to solve challenging problems!

##Familiar functions

Out of the box, Python offers a bunch of built-in functions to make your life as a data scientist easier. You already know two such functions: `print()` and `type()`. You've also used the functions `str()`, `int()`, `bool()` and `float()` to switch between data types. These are built-in functions as well.

Calling a function is easy. To get the type of `3.0` and store the output as a new variable, `result`, you can use the following:

```
result = type(3.0)
```

The general recipe for calling functions and saving the result to a variable is thus:

```
output = function_name(input)
```

INSTRUCTIONS

Use `print()` in combination with `type()` to print out the type of `var1`.

Use `len()` to get the length of the list var1. Wrap it in a `print()` call to directly print it out.

Use `int()` to convert `var2` to an integer. Store the output as `out2`.

```{python}

# Create variables var1 and var2
var1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var2 = True

# Print out type of var1
print(type(var1))

# Print out length of var1
print(len(var1))

# Convert var2 to an integer: out2
out2 = int(var2)
```


##Multiple arguments
In the previous exercise, the square brackets around `imag` in the documentation showed us that the `imag` argument is optional. But Python also uses a different way to tell users about arguments being optional.

Have a look at the documentation of `sorted()` by typing `help(sorted)` in the IPython Shell.

You'll see that `sorted()` takes three arguments: `iterable`, `key` and `reverse`.

`key=None` means that if you don't specify the key argument, it will be `None`. `reverse=False` means that if you don't specify the reverse argument, it will be `False`.

In this exercise, you'll only have to specify `iterable` and `reverse`, not `key`. The first input you pass to `sorted()` will be matched to the `iterable` argument, but what about the second input? To tell Python you want to specify `reverse` without changing anything about `key`, you can use `=`:

```
sorted(___, reverse = ___)
```

Two lists have been created for you on the right. Can you paste them together and sort them in descending order?

Note: For now, we can understand an `iterable` as being any collection of objects, e.g. a List.

INSTRUCTIONS

Use `+` to merge the contents of `first` and `second` into a new list: full.

Call `sorted()` on `full` and specify the `reverse` argument to be `True`. Save the sorted list as `full_sorted`.

Finish off by printing out `full_sorted`.

```{python}
# Create lists first and second
first = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0]
second = [10.75, 9.50]

# Paste together first and second: full
full = first + second

# Sort full in descending order: full_sorted
full_sorted = sorted(full, reverse= True)

# Print out full_sorted
print(full_sorted)

```

##String Methods

Strings come with a bunch of methods. Follow the instructions closely to discover some of them. If you want to discover them in more detail, you can always type `help(str)` in the IPython Shell.

A string `room` has already been created for you to experiment with.

INSTRUCTIONS

Use the `upper()` method on `room` and store the result in `room_up`. Use the syntax for calling methods that you learned in the previous video.

Print out `room` and `room_up`. Did both change?

Print out the number of o's on the variable `room` by calling `count()` on `room` and passing the letter `"o"` as an input to the method. We're talking about the variable `room`, not the word `"room"`!

```{python}
# string to experiment with: room
room = "poolhouse"

# Use upper() on room: room_up
room_up = room.upper()

# Print out room and room_up
print(room)
print(room_up)

# Print out the number of o's in room
print(room.count("o"))
```

##List Methods

Strings are not the only Python types that have methods associated with them. Lists, floats, integers and booleans are also types that come packaged with a bunch of useful methods. In this exercise, you'll be experimenting with:

`index()`, to get the index of the first element of a list that matches its input and

`count()`, to get the number of times an element appears in a list.

You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of a house: `areas`.

INSTRUCTIONS

Use the `index()` method to get the index of the element in `areas` that is equal to `20.0`. Print out this index.

Call `count()` on `areas` to find out how many times `14.5` appears in the list. Again, simply print out this number.

```{python}
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Print out the index of the element 20.0
print(areas.index(20.0))

# Print out how often 14.5 appears in areas
print(areas.count(14.5))

```

##List Methods (2)

Most list methods will change the list they're called on. Examples are:

- `append()`, that adds an element to the list it is called on,

- `remove()`, that removes the first element of a list that matches the input, and

- 1reverse()`, that reverses the order of the elements in the list it is called on.
You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of the house: `areas`.

INSTRUCTIONS

Use `append()` twice to add the size of the poolhouse and the garage again: `24.`5 and `15.45`, respectively. Make sure to add them in this order.

Print out `areas`

Use the `reverse()` method to reverse the order of the elements in `areas`.

Print out `areas` once more.

```{python}
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Use append twice to add poolhouse and garage size
areas.append(24.5)
areas.append(15.45)


# Print out areas
print(areas)

# Reverse the orders of the elements in areas
areas.reverse()

# Print out areas
print(areas)

```

##Import package

As a data scientist, some notions of geometry never hurt. Let's refresh some of the basics.

For a fancy clustering algorithm, you want to find the circumference, C, and area, A, of a circle. When the radius of the circle is `r`, you can calculate C and A as:

C=2πr  
A=πr^2

To use the constant `pi`, you'll need the math package. A variable `r` is already coded in the script. Fill in the code to calculate `C` and `A` and see how the `print()` functions create some nice printouts.


INSTRUCTIONS

Import the `math` package. Now you can access the constant `pi` with `math.pi`.

Calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in `C`.

Calculate the area of the circle and store it in `A`.

```{python}


# Definition of radius
r = 0.43

# Import the math package
import math

# Calculate C
C = 2 * math.pi * r

# Calculate A
A = math.pi * r**2

# Build printout
print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))

```

##Selective import

General imports, like `import math`, make all functionality from the math package available to you. However, if you decide to only use a specific part of a package, you can always make your import more selective:

```
from math import pi
```

Let's say the Moon's orbit around planet Earth is a perfect circle, with a radius `r` (in km) that is defined in the script.

INSTRUCTIONS

Perform a selective import from the `math` package where you only import the `radians` function.

Calculate the distance travelled by the Moon over 12 degrees of its orbit. Assign the result to `dist`. You can calculate this as `r` * `phi`, where `r` is the radius and `phi` is the angle in radians. To convert an angle in degrees to an angle in radians, use the `radians()` function, which you just imported.

Print out `dist`.

```{python}
# Definition of radius
r = 192500

# Import radians function of math package
from math import radians

# Travel distance of Moon over 12 degrees. Store in dist.
dist = r * radians(12)

# Print out dist
print(dist)

```


#Chapter 4: NumPy
NumPy is a Python package to efficiently do data science. Learn to work with the NumPy array, a faster and more powerful alternative to the list, and take your first steps in data exploration.

##Your First NumPy Array

In this chapter, we're going to dive into the world of baseball. Along the way, you'll get comfortable with the basics of `numpy`, a powerful package to do data science.

A list` baseball` has already been defined in the Python script, representing the height of some baseball players in centimeters. Can you add some code here and there to create a `numpy` array from it?

INSTRUCTIONS

Import the numpy package as `np`, so that you can refer to `numpy` with `np`.

Use `np.array()` to create a `numpy` array from `baseball`. Name this array `np_baseball`.

Print out the type of `np_baseball` to check that you got it right.

```{python}

# Create list baseball
baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]


# Import the numpy package as np
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))
```


##Baseball players' height

You are a huge baseball fan. You decide to call the MLB (Major League Baseball) and ask around for some more statistics on the height of the main players. They pass along data on more than a thousand players, which is stored as a regular Python list: `height`. The height is expressed in inches. Can you make a `numpy` array out of it and convert the units to meters?

`height` is already available and the `numpy` package is loaded, so you can start straight away (Source: stat.ucla.edu).

INSTRUCTIONS

Create a `numpy` array from `height`. Name this new array `np_height`.

Print `np_height`.

Multiply `np_height` with `0.0254` to convert all height measurements from inches to meters. Store the new values in a new array, `np_height_m`.

Print out `np_height_m` and check if the output makes sense.

```{python}
# height is available as a regular list
#Note from neil: I created a subset of the height list... it was too much to store in a list in R-Notebook

height = [74, 74, 72, 72, 73, 69, 69, 71, 76, 71, 73, 73, 74, 74, 69, 70, 73, 75, 78, 79, 76, 74, 76, 72, 71, 75, 77, 74, 73, 74, 78, 73, 75, 73, 75, 75, 74, 69, 71, 74, 73, 73, 76, 74, 74, 70, 72, 77, 74, 70, 73, 75, 76, 76, 78, 74, 74, 76, 77, 81, 78, 75, 77, 75, 76, 74, 72, 72, 75, 73, 73, 73, 70, 70, 70, 76, 68, 71, 72, 75, 75, 75, 75, 68, 74, 78, 71, 73, 76, 74, 74, 79, 75, 73, 76, 74, 74, 73, 72, 74, 73, 74, 72, 73, 69, 72, 73, 75, 75, 73, 72, 72, 76, 74, 72, 77, 74, 77, 75, 76, 80, 74, 74, 75, 78, 73, 73, 74, 75, 76, 71, 73, 74, 76, 76, 74, 73, 74, 70, 72, 73, 73, 73, 73, 71, 74, 74, 72, 74, 71, 74, 73, 75, 75, 79, 73, 75, 76, 74, 76, 78, 74, 76, 72, 74, 76, 74, 75, 78, 75, 72, 74, 72, 74, 70, 71, 70, 75, 71, 71, 73, 72, 71, 73, 72, 75, 74, 74, 75, 73, 77, 73, 76, 75, 74, 76, 75, 73, 71, 76, 75, 72, 71, 77, 73, 74, 71, 72, 74, 75, 73, 72, 75, 75, 74, 72, 74, 71, 70, 74, 77, 77, 75, 75, 78, 75, 76, 73, 75, 75, 79, 77, 76, 71, 75, 74, 69, 71, 76, 72, 72, 70, 72, 73, 71, 72, 71, 73, 72, 73, 74, 74, 72, 75, 74, 74, 77, 75, 73, 72, 71, 74, 77, 75, 75, 75, 78, 78, 74, 76, 78, 76, 70, 72, 80, 74, 74, 71, 70, 72, 71, 74, 71, 72, 71, 74, 69, 76, 75, 75, 76, 73, 76, 73, 77, 73, 72, 72, 77, 77, 71, 74, 74, 73, 78, 75, 73, 70, 74, 72, 73, 73, 75, 75, 74, 76, 73, 74, 75, 75, 72, 73, 73, 72, 74, 78, 76, 73, 74, 75, 70, 75, 71, 72, 78, 75, 73, 73, 71, 75, 77, 72, 69, 73, 74, 72, 70, 75, 70, 72, 72, 74, 73, 74, 76, 75, 80, 72, 75, 73, 74, 74, 73, 75, 75, 71, 73, 75, 74, 74, 72, 74, 74, 74, 73, 76, 75, 72, 73, 73, 73]

```

##Baseball player's BMI

The MLB also offers to let you analyze their weight data. Again, both are available as regular Python lists: height and weight. `height` is in inches and `weight` is in pounds.

It's now possible to calculate the BMI of each baseball player. Python code to convert `height` to a `numpy` array with the correct units is already available in the workspace. Follow the instructions step by step and finish the game!

INSTRUCTIONS

Create a `numpy` array from the `weight` list with the correct units. Multiply by `0.453592` to go from pounds to kilograms. Store the resulting `numpy` array as `np_weight_kg`.

Use `np_height_m` and `np_weight_kg` to calculate the BMI of each player. Use the following equation:

BMI=weight(kg)/height(m)^2

Save the resulting `numpy` array as `bmi`.
Print out bmi.



```{python}
height = [74, 74, 72, 72, 73, 69, 69, 71, 76, 71, 73, 73, 74, 74, 69, 70, 73, 75, 78, 79, 76, 74, 76, 72, 71, 75, 77, 74, 73, 74, 78, 73, 75, 73, 75, 75, 74, 69, 71, 74, 73, 73, 76, 74, 74, 70, 72, 77, 74, 70, 73, 75, 76, 76, 78, 74, 74, 76, 77, 81, 78, 75, 77, 75, 76, 74, 72, 72, 75, 73, 73, 73, 70, 70, 70, 76, 68, 71, 72, 75, 75, 75, 75, 68, 74, 78, 71, 73, 76, 74, 74, 79, 75, 73, 76, 74, 74, 73, 72, 74, 73, 74, 72, 73, 69, 72, 73, 75, 75, 73, 72, 72, 76, 74, 72, 77, 74, 77, 75, 76, 80, 74, 74, 75, 78, 73, 73, 74, 75, 76, 71, 73, 74, 76, 76, 74, 73, 74, 70, 72, 73, 73, 73, 73, 71, 74, 74, 72, 74, 71, 74, 73, 75, 75, 79, 73, 75, 76, 74, 76, 78, 74, 76, 72, 74, 76, 74, 75, 78, 75, 72, 74, 72, 74, 70, 71, 70, 75, 71, 71, 73, 72, 71, 73, 72, 75, 74, 74, 75, 73, 77, 73, 76, 75, 74, 76, 75, 73, 71, 76, 75, 72, 71, 77, 73, 74, 71, 72, 74, 75, 73, 72, 75, 75, 74, 72, 74, 71, 70, 74, 77, 77, 75, 75, 78, 75, 76, 73, 75, 75, 79, 77, 76, 71, 75, 74, 69, 71, 76, 72, 72, 70, 72, 73, 71, 72, 71, 73, 72, 73, 74, 74, 72, 75, 74, 74, 77, 75, 73, 72, 71, 74, 77, 75, 75, 75, 78, 78, 74, 76, 78, 76, 70, 72, 80, 74, 74, 71, 70, 72, 71, 74, 71, 72, 71, 74, 69, 76, 75, 75, 76, 73, 76, 73, 77, 73, 72, 72, 77, 77, 71, 74, 74, 73, 78, 75, 73, 70, 74, 72, 73, 73, 75, 75, 74, 76, 73, 74, 75, 75, 72, 73, 73, 72, 74, 78, 76, 73, 74, 75, 70, 75, 71, 72, 78, 75, 73, 73, 71, 75, 77, 72, 69, 73, 74, 72, 70, 75, 70, 72, 72, 74, 73, 74, 76, 75, 80, 72, 75, 73, 74, 74, 73, 75, 75, 71, 73, 75, 74, 74, 72, 74, 74, 74, 73, 76, 75, 72, 73, 73, 73]

```

##Lightweight baseball players
To subset both regular Python lists and numpy arrays, you can use square brackets:

```
x = [4 , 9 , 6, 3, 1]
x[1]
import numpy as np
y = np.array(x)
y[1]
```

For `numpy` specifically, you can also use boolean `numpy` arrays:

```
high = y > 5
y[high]
```

The code that calculates the BMI of all baseball players is already included. Follow the instructions and reveal interesting things from the data!

INSTRUCTIONS

Create a boolean `numpy` array: the element of the array should be `True` if the corresponding baseball player's BMI is below 21. You can use the `<` operator for this. Name the array `light`.

Print the array `light`.

Print out a `numpy` array with the BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21. Use `light` inside square brackets to do a selection on the `bmi` array.

##Subsetting NumPy Arrays

You've seen it with your own eyes: Python lists and `numpy` arrays sometimes behave differently. Luckily, there are still certainties in this world. For example, subsetting (using the square bracket notation on lists or arrays) works exactly the same. To see this for yourself, try the following lines of code in the IPython Shell:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c"]
x[1]

np_x = np.array(x)
np_x[1]
```

The script on the right already contains code that imports `numpy` as `np`, and stores both the height and weight of the MLB players as `numpy` arrays.

INSTRUCTIONS

Subset `np_weight`: print out the element at index 50.

Print out a sub-array ofc`np_height`: It contains the elements at index 100 up to **and including index 110**

```{python}
height = [74, 74, 72, 72, 73, 69, 69, 71, 76, 71, 73, 73, 74, 74, 69, 70, 73, 75, 78, 79, 76, 74, 76, 72, 71, 75, 77, 74, 73, 74, 78, 73, 75, 73, 75, 75, 74, 69, 71, 74, 73, 73, 76, 74, 74, 70, 72, 77, 74, 70, 73, 75, 76, 76, 78, 74, 74, 76, 77, 81, 78, 75, 77, 75, 76, 74, 72, 72, 75, 73, 73, 73, 70, 70, 70, 76, 68, 71, 72, 75, 75, 75, 75, 68, 74, 78, 71, 73, 76, 74, 74, 79, 75, 73, 76, 74, 74, 73, 72, 74, 73, 74, 72, 73, 69, 72, 73, 75, 75, 73, 72, 72, 76, 74, 72, 77, 74, 77, 75, 76, 80, 74, 74, 75, 78, 73, 73, 74, 75, 76, 71, 73, 74, 76, 76, 74, 73, 74, 70, 72, 73, 73, 73, 73, 71, 74, 74, 72, 74, 71, 74, 73, 75, 75, 79, 73, 75, 76, 74, 76, 78, 74, 76, 72, 74, 76, 74, 75, 78, 75, 72, 74, 72, 74, 70, 71, 70, 75, 71, 71, 73, 72, 71, 73, 72, 75, 74, 74, 75, 73, 77, 73, 76, 75, 74, 76, 75, 73, 71, 76, 75, 72, 71, 77, 73, 74, 71, 72, 74, 75, 73, 72, 75, 75, 74, 72, 74, 71, 70, 74, 77, 77, 75, 75, 78, 75, 76, 73, 75, 75, 79, 77, 76, 71, 75, 74, 69, 71, 76, 72, 72, 70, 72, 73, 71, 72, 71, 73, 72, 73, 74, 74, 72, 75, 74, 74, 77, 75, 73, 72, 71, 74, 77, 75, 75, 75, 78, 78, 74, 76, 78, 76, 70, 72, 80, 74, 74, 71, 70, 72, 71, 74, 71, 72, 71, 74, 69, 76, 75, 75, 76, 73, 76, 73, 77, 73, 72, 72, 77, 77, 71, 74, 74, 73, 78, 75, 73, 70, 74, 72, 73, 73, 75, 75, 74, 76, 73, 74, 75, 75, 72, 73, 73, 72, 74, 78, 76, 73, 74, 75, 70, 75, 71, 72, 78, 75, 73, 73, 71, 75, 77, 72, 69, 73, 74, 72, 70, 75, 70, 72, 72, 74, 73, 74, 76, 75, 80, 72, 75, 73, 74, 74, 73, 75, 75, 71, 73, 75, 74, 74, 72, 74, 74, 74, 73, 76, 75, 72, 73, 73, 73]

##Your First 2D NumPy Array

Before working on the actual MLB data, let's try to create a 2D `numpy` array from a small list of lists.

In this exercise, `baseball` is a list of lists. The main list contains 4 elements. Each of these elements is a list containing the height and the weight of 4 baseball players, in this order. `baseball` is already coded for you in the script.

INSTRUCTIONS

Use `np.array()` to create a 2D `numpy` array from `baseball`. Name it `np_baseball`.

Print out the type of `np_baseball`.

Print out the shape attribute of `np_baseball`. Use `np_baseball.shape`

```{python}
# Create baseball, a list of lists
baseball = [[180, 78.4],
            [215, 102.7],
            [210, 98.5],
            [188, 75.2]]

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))

# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print(np_baseball.shape)
```

##Baseball data in 2D form
You have another look at the MLB data and realize that it makes more sense to restructure all this information in a 2D `numpy` array. This array should have 1015 rows, corresponding to the 1015 baseball players you have information on, and 2 columns (for height and weight).

The MLB was, again, very helpful and passed you the data in a different structure, a Python list of lists. In this list of lists, each sublist represents the height and weight of a single baseball player. The name of this embedded list is `baseball`.

Can you store the data as a 2D array to unlock `numpy`'s extra functionality?

INSTRUCTIONS

Use `np.array()` to create a 2D `numpy` array from `baseball`. Name it `np_baseball`.

##Subsetting 2D NumPy Arrays

If your 2D `numpy` array has a regular structure, i.e. each row and column has a fixed number of values, complicated ways of subsetting become very easy. Have a look at the code below where the elements `"a"` and `"c"` are extracted from a list of lists.

```
# regular list of lists
x = [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]
[x[0][0], x[1][0]]

# numpy
import numpy as np
np_x = np.array(x)
np_x[:,0]
```

For regular Python lists, this is a real pain. For 2D `numpy arrays`, however, it's pretty intuitive! The indexes before the comma refer to the rows, while those after the comma refer to the columns. The `:` is for slicing; in this example, it tells Python to include all rows.

The code that converts the pre-loaded `baseball` list to a 2D `numpy` array is already in the script. The first column contains the players' height in inches and the second column holds player weight, in pounds. Add some lines to make the correct selections. Remember that in Python, the first element is at index 0!

INSTRUCTIONS

Print out the 50th row of `np_baseball`.

Make a new variable, `np_weight`, containing the entire second column of `np_baseball`.

Select the height (first column) of the 124th baseball player in `np_baseball` and print it out.

##2D Arithmetic

Remember how you calculated the Body Mass Index for all baseball players? `numpy` was able to perform all calculations element-wise (i.e. element by element). For 2D `numpy` arrays this isn't any different! You can combine matrices with single numbers, with vectors, and with other matrices.

Execute the code below in the IPython shell and see if you understand:

```
import numpy as np
np_mat = np.array([[1, 2],
                   [3, 4],
                   [5, 6]])
np_mat * 2
np_mat + np.array([10, 10])
np_mat + np_mat
```

`np_baseball` is coded for you; it's again a 2D `numpy` array with 3 columns representing height, weight and age.

INSTRUCTIONS

You managed to get hold of the changes in weight, height and age of all baseball players. It is available as a 2D `numpy` array, updated. Add `np_baseball` and `updated` and print out the result.

You want to convert the units of `height` and `weight`. As a first step, create a `numpy` array with three values: `0.0254`, `0.453592` and `1`. Name this array `conversion`.

Multiply `np_baseball` with `conversion` and print out the result.
