[Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/home) is an online series of courses meant to provide users with the programming skills necessary to perform proper data science by some of the most well-known instructors (e.g. one of my personal heroes: [Hadley Wickham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham). I was given free access to these courses from my research methods course (Psy 652 & Psy 653). I decided to take advantage of this opportunity. This is my documentation as I progress through these classes. If you are interested in programming and data science, I would highly recommend looking into these perusing this repository. I hope it serves as a jumping point to anyone looking to incorporate high-level programming into their research and data-driven careers.

I have provided these files for myself and anyone interested. They provide some very useful instructions to programming in R. They also teach how to program in Python & SQL. This repository is based on my interest and time in completing and documenting the courses. Please do not hesitate to let me know if you have any questions. If you would like to contribute to this repository, please email me at <ndyetz@gmail.com>!
